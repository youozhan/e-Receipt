The message that we often get from a system like YouTube is that algorithms are promoting our experience. Algorithms work together to teach us how to use tools, broadcast new movie trailers, and show us what is life like in another country. Hidden Systems tells the story of how algorithms' intention is more than that, or more precisely, is never that. 

Hidden Systems examines and visualizes the algorithm's intention in the case of video-sharing platforms. It takes the form of a Chrome browser extension and a data visualization to scrape data from websites and produce a possible interpretation of the algorithm-controlled process within the system of video consumption. It is based on the recommendation system and the content monetization system from YouTube.
