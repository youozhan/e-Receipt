Hidden Systems examines and visualizes the algorithm's intention in the case of video-sharing platforms. It takes the form of a Chrome browser extension and a data visualization to scrape data from websites and produce a possible interpretation of the algorithm-controlled process within the system of video consumption. It is based on the recommendation system and the content monetization system from YouTube.
